# Utilizing Mask-RCNN for Banana Ripeness Classification for Individual Bananas in Banana Bunches

This repository contains the Google Colaboratory (Colab) notebook and associated resources for the model developed in the thesis paper titled: **"Utilizing Mask-RCNN for Banana Ripeness Classification for Individual Bananas in Banana Bunches"**.

The project focuses on employing the Mask R-CNN deep learning architecture to not only detect and segment individual bananas within a bunch but also to classify their ripeness stage (e.g., unripe, ripe, overripe).
